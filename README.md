# parse-free-lisp-like-formatter

A formatter for a small Lisp-like language
that works by just tokenizing the code,
but not parsing it.
Created for fun and learning.
There is also an alternative recursive implementation
written in Reason included in the src folder,
with a very nice lexer but a somewhat confusing printer.
